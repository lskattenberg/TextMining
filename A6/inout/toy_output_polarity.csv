ID-808 	positive	negative	In early September, mom and dad got a call from the Annandale police notifying them that Chris' abandoned car had been identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol after a group of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert.
ID-809 	positive	negative	There were no signs that Chris had intended to return to it.
ID-810 	positive	negative	But there wasn't any evidence of struggle.
ID-811 	positive	negative	The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him.
ID-812 	positive	positive	Nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that Chris was actually trying not to be found.

ID-826 	positive	neutral	Carine sits at the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching her brother with a hint of concern.
ID-827 	positive	positive	CHRIS (a little drunk, a little emotional) Dad, you and I have had our differences over the years...but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for all the things you've given me.
ID-828 	positive	negative	And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids.
ID-829 	positive	negative	So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit...at Domino's Pizza -  Chris moves to the gift.
ID-830 	positive	positive	CHRIS (CONT'D) and I've gotten you this token, this damned expensive token, as a token of that appreciation.
ID-831 	positive	positive	Chris holds the large gift toward Walt.
ID-832 	positive	positive	Walt moves through his friends to Chris and strips the paper, exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.
ID-833 	positive	neutral	WALT (patting his son the back) Would you look at that.
ID-834 	positive	neutral	Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.
ID-835 	positive	positive	And the party responds with applause.
ID-836 	positive	positive	Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.
ID-837 	positive	neutral	CARINE Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.
ID-838 	positive	neutral	CHRIS Too much and not enough.
ID-839 	positive	neutral	I used to believe all that stuff.
ID-840 	positive	neutral	That whole story.

ID-849 	positive	positive	The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer.
ID-850 	positive	neutral	It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale.
ID-851 	positive	neutral	He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin.
ID-852 	positive	neutral	As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
ID-853 	positive	positive	In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there.
ID-854 	positive	neutral	He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.

ID-856 	positive	neutral	CARINE And that one lie had led to another.
ID-857 	positive	neutral	That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia.
ID-858 	positive	negative	Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time.
ID-859 	positive	negative	And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children.

ID-861 	positive	negative	CARINE Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused.
ID-862 	positive	negative	And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice.
ID-863 	positive	neutral	(MORE)  39aA.
ID-864 	positive	negative	CARINE (CONT'D) She and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasn't the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real.

ID-918 	positive	neutral	CHRIS I was thinking about doubling back through the Canadian side of Glacier Park.
ID-919 	positive	positive	WAYNE Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the Black Feet Res.

ID-930 	positive	negative	We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch.
ID-931 	positive	neutral	But then I got this little black box deal on the side (You know what I mean?)
ID-932 	positive	positive	CHRIS You mean those free satellite TV deals?
ID-933 	positive	neutral	WAYNE (as though he hadn't brought it up) You said it, not me.
ID-934 	positive	neutral	Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.
ID-935 	positive	neutral	Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food.
ID-936 	positive	neutral	As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind rocks the trailer.
ID-937 	positive	positive	WAYNE (CONT'D) (smiling, responding to wind) OOOOOOH.

ID-951 	positive	neutral	He's from Madison.
ID-952 	positive	neutral	CHRIS Madison.
ID-953 	positive	positive	Okay.
ID-954 	positive	neutral	Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell.
ID-955 	positive	neutral	A couple hits of lightning follow.
ID-956 	positive	negative	WAYNE Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight.
ID-957 	positive	positive	Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning.
ID-958 	positive	neutral	Chris looks about.
ID-959 	positive	neutral	There's not much room but it beats the pelting outside.
ID-960 	positive	positive	CHRIS Thanks Wayne.
ID-961 	positive	neutral	I will.
ID-962 	positive	positive	TIME CUT:  Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN.

ID-971 	positive	negative	Now take hold of the joystick, get the feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch...  As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.
ID-972 	positive	neutral	WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine.
ID-973 	positive	neutral	In the background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain.
