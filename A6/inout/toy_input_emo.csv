ID-4 ;anger;A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop.
ID-5 ;anger;A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck.

ID-11 ;anger;BACKPACK walks back to the truck.
ID-12 ;anger;As he approaches the driver's door, we  CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER.
ID-13 ;anger;DRIVER (CONT'D) (referring to items we see sitting on dashboard) You left your watch, your comb, your change...  We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:  BACKPACK Keep it.
ID-14 ;anger;DRIVER I don't want your money.
ID-15 ;anger;And I already have a watch.

ID-22 ;anger;DRIVER (handing him the boots) Take em.
ID-23 ;anger;There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.
ID-24 ;anger;DRIVER (CONT'D) If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
ID-25 ;anger;We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
ID-26 ;anger;BACKPACK Hey, do me a favor, will ya?
ID-27 ;anger;Take a picture of me.
ID-28 ;anger;Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards.

ID-66 ;anger;I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die.

ID-430;disgust;Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.
ID-431;disgust;CHRIS (as he drops the knife to the ground) Sorry.
ID-432;disgust;I thought you were a bear.
ID-433;disgust;FOREST RANGER (approaching) I don't blame you.
ID-434;disgust;You're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den.
ID-435;disgust;That's why I came over here to talk to you.
ID-436;disgust;Do you have some identification?
ID-437;disgust;22.
ID-438;disgust;CHRIS No.
ID-439;disgust;I'm sorry.
ID-440;disgust;My name's Alex.
ID-441;disgust;I've been travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken.
ID-442;disgust;FOREST RANGER You mind if I take a look in your tent?
ID-443;disgust;CHRIS Go ahead.
ID-444;disgust;The Forest Ranger bends over.
ID-445;disgust;Pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re- addressing Chris.
ID-446;disgust;FOREST RANGER You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?
ID-447;disgust;CHRIS (giggles) No.
ID-448;disgust;FOREST RANGER Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
ID-449;disgust;CHRIS Well, I don't have a permit.
ID-450;disgust;FOREST RANGER No, I'm sure you don't.
ID-451;disgust;Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight.
ID-452;disgust;But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes.
ID-453;disgust;Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit.
ID-454;disgust;CHRIS Alright.
ID-455;disgust;I appreciate it.
ID-456;disgust;I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.
ID-457;disgust;FOREST RANGER Be careful.

ID-496;disgust;These are my personal items.
ID-497;disgust;POLICEMAN Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
ID-498;disgust;CHRIS You're kidding.
ID-499;disgust;POLICEMAN Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop?
ID-500;disgust;We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here.
ID-501;disgust;And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.
ID-502;disgust;CHRIS Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car.

ID-248 ;fear;He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do?
ID-249 ;fear;CONTINUE VIDEO:  We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of Ted Turner.

ID-282 ;fear;As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed.

ID-294 ;fear;When we were little, Chris was very to himself.
ID-295 ;fear;He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends.
ID-296 ;fear;He could be alone without being lonely.
ID-297 ;fear;The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young.
ID-298 ;fear;It seemed like they never fought without us.
ID-299 ;fear;I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce.
ID-300 ;fear;They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with.
ID-301 ;fear;I cried my eyes out.
ID-302 ;fear;But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped.
ID-303 ;fear;It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
ID-304 ;fear;Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money.
ID-305 ;fear;Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik.
ID-306 ;fear;And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge.

ID-532;disgust;(CONT'D) My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.
ID-533 ;fear;Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads.
ID-534 ;fear;Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa.
ID-535 ;fear;Ultimately turning up nothing.
ID-536 ;fear;What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car.
ID-537 ;fear;He seemed to love that Datsun so much.

ID-573 ;fear;JAN (CONT'D) When's the last time you ate something?
ID-574 ;fear;Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's collected.
ID-575 ;fear;CHRIS (excited) See that?
ID-576 ;fear;I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible.

ID-594 ;fear;It was a great car too.
ID-595 ;fear;I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school.
ID-596 ;fear;I had some really great adventures with it.

ID-635 ;fear;As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire.

ID-874;disgust;Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time.
ID-875;disgust;It was inevitable that Chris would rebel.
ID-876;disgust;And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.

ID-925 ;joy;WAYNE Well, I do a lot of things.
ID-926 ;joy;Computer programming.
ID-927 ;joy;Video game repair.
ID-928 ;joy;I'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town.
ID-929 ;joy;But in the summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian border.
ID-930 ;joy;We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch.
ID-931 ;joy;But then I got this little black box deal on the side (You know what I mean?)
ID-932 ;joy;CHRIS You mean those free satellite TV deals?
ID-933 ;joy;WAYNE (as though he hadn't brought it up) You said it, not me.
ID-934 ;joy;Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.
ID-935 ;joy;Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food.
ID-936 ;joy;As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind rocks the trailer.
ID-937 ;joy;WAYNE (CONT'D) (smiling, responding to wind) OOOOOOH.
ID-938 ;joy;Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food.
ID-939 ;joy;Points to the unconscious tribe splayed out.
ID-940 ;joy;SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.
ID-941 ;joy;CHRIS Who are these guys?
ID-942 ;joy;Wayne gets a little giggle.
ID-943 ;joy;WAYNE Those are my Hudderites.
ID-944 ;joy;Agriculture's a pretty transient business.
ID-945 ;joy;These guys come off the Hudderite colony looking for work.
ID-946 ;joy;I always got work for people.
ID-947 ;joy;Then that guy - (MORE)  42A.
ID-948 ;joy;WAYNE (CONT'D) (pointing at guy making most of his snore) That's Kevin.
ID-949 ;joy;He's with me most of the time.
ID-950 ;joy;He's not a Hudderite.
ID-951 ;joy;He's from Madison.
ID-952 ;joy;CHRIS Madison.
ID-953 ;joy;Okay.
ID-954 ;joy;Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell.
ID-955 ;joy;A couple hits of lightning follow.
ID-956 ;joy;WAYNE Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight.
ID-957 ;joy;Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning.
ID-958 ;joy;Chris looks about.
ID-959 ;joy;There's not much room but it beats the pelting outside.
ID-960 ;joy;CHRIS Thanks Wayne.
ID-961 ;joy;I will.
ID-962 ;joy;TIME CUT:  Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN.
ID-963 ;joy;Wayne comes from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping bodies to hand Chris a pillow.
ID-964 ;joy;WAYNE Get a good sleep.
ID-965 ;joy;See you in the morning.
ID-966 ;joy;Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head and closes his eyes.

ID-969 ;joy;43.
ID-970 ;joy;WAYNE (O.S) Okay.
ID-971 ;joy;Now take hold of the joystick, get the feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch...  As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.
ID-972 ;joy;WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine.
ID-973 ;joy;In the background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain.
ID-974 ;joy;Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.
ID-975 ;joy;This time the thing starts to move.
ID-976 ;joy;WAYNE (CONT'D) That's it.
ID-977 ;joy;That's it.
ID-978 ;joy;Now take it on out and make yourself some money.
ID-979 ;joy;Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.
ID-980 ;joy;Wayne laughs his ass off.

ID-984 ;joy;Talking politics and bullshit, and eating a welcome meal.
ID-985 ;joy;WAYNE I'm gonna break out some whiskey.
ID-986 ;joy;Alex, you want anything other than that beer?
ID-987 ;joy;CHRIS I'd take a White Russian if you've got it.
ID-988 ;joy;The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a fancy drink.
ID-989 ;joy;44.
ID-990 ;joy;MAN #1 What are you Alex, a Commie?
ID-991 ;joy;CHRIS No, I just like White Russians.
ID-992 ;joy;WAYNE I haven't got anything like that here.
ID-993 ;joy;But I tell ya what.
ID-994 ;joy;And I know I speak for everybody.
ID-995 ;joy;You wanna come work with us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a White Russian down at the Cabaret.
ID-996 ;joy;CHRIS Really?
