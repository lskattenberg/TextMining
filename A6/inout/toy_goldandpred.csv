ID-2	J	A	THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1  SUPER: Tuesday, April 28th 1992  WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America.
ID-3	A	A	This is BIG Alaska.
ID-4	A	A	A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop.
ID-5	A	A	A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck.
ID-6	A	A	We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack.
ID-7	A	A	We HEAR a very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.
ID-8	A	A	DRIVER Hey!
ID-9	A	A	The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.
ID-10	A	A	DRIVER (CONT'D) Come here.
ID-11	A	A	BACKPACK walks back to the truck.
ID-12	A	A	As he approaches the driver's door, we  CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER.
ID-13	A	A	DRIVER (CONT'D) (referring to items we see sitting on dashboard) You left your watch, your comb, your change...  We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:  BACKPACK Keep it.
ID-14	A	A	DRIVER I don't want your money.
ID-15	A	A	And I already have a watch.
ID-16	A	A	BACKPACK If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away.
ID-17	A	A	I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am.
ID-18	A	A	(MORE)  2.
ID-19	A	A	BACKPACK (CONT'D) I don't want to see anybody.
ID-20	A	A	None of that matters.
ID-21	A	A	The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots.
ID-22	A	A	DRIVER (handing him the boots) Take em.
ID-23	A	A	There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.
ID-24	A	A	DRIVER (CONT'D) If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
ID-25	A	A	We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
ID-26	A	A	BACKPACK Hey, do me a favor, will ya?
ID-27	A	A	Take a picture of me.
ID-28	A	A	Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards.
ID-29	A	A	We PULL BACK with him.
ID-30	A	A	And he maintains his back to us.
ID-31	A	A	When he stops, we CONTINUE until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.
ID-32	A	A	CUT TO:  CU: driver  CLICK.
ID-33	A	A	He snaps the shot.
ID-34	A	A	Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.
ID-35	A	A	Driver hands him the camera.
ID-36	A	A	DRIVER You gonna be alright?
ID-37	A	A	BACKPACK I'll be better than that.
ID-38	A	A	(I'll be who I am.)
ID-39	A	A	As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash.
ID-40	A	A	3.
ID-41	A	A	Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE SNOW, FADE into the distance.
ID-42	A	A	BACK TO:  ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:  We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame.
ID-43	A	A	The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came.
ID-44	A	A	As the truck exits frame, we -  DISSOLVE TO:   2   EXT.
ID-45	A	A	COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2 DAY  SUPER: May 1990  The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.
ID-46	A	A	Assembled on fold-out chairs.
ID-47	A	A	The broad lawn.
ID-48	A	A	INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS.
ID-49	A	A	We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.
ID-50	A	A	One by one the names of graduates announced.
ID-51	A	A	Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas.
ID-52	A	A	INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
ID-53	A	A	Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes
ID-54	A	A	They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight.
ID-55	A	A	INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.
ID-56	A	A	From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.
ID-57	A	A	The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown.
ID-58	A	A	4.
ID-59	A	A	Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine "That's our Chris."
ID-60	A	A	And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps.
ID-61	A	A	TIME CUT:  SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a frame of blue sky.
ID-62	A	A	We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his parents.
ID-63	A	A	(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie delight upon the caps.)
ID-64	A	A	An outer glee in sharp contrast to voice over:  CHRIS (V.O.)
ID-65	A	A	I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head, I see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married, they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
ID-66	A	A	I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die.
ID-67	A	A	I want to go up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, (MORE)  5.
ID-68	A	A	CHRIS (V.O.)
ID-69	A	A	(CONT'D) her pitiful beautiful untouched body, his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it.
ID-70	A	A	I want to live.
ID-71	A	A	I take them up like the male and female paper dolls and bang them together at the hips like chips of flint as if to strike sparks from them, I say...
ID-72	A	A	The last graduation cap falls out of the `blue sky' frame, and into...  CUT TO:   3   INT.

ID-79	A	A	CARINE Who wrote that?
ID-80	A	A	CHRIS Well, it could've been either one of us, couldn't it?
ID-81	A	A	He hands a book of Sharon Olds' poetry to her.
ID-82	A	A	CHRIS (CONT'D) There's a lot of great poems in there.

ID-90	A	A	Chris gives Carine a look.
ID-91	A	A	Walt extends his hand to Chris.

ID-98	A	A	CHRIS My grades are gonna be good enough, I think, to get into Harvard Law.
ID-99	A	A	WALT That's a big deal.
ID-100	A	A	What do you have left in your college fund?
ID-101	A	A	CHRIS It's an inheritance, dad.
ID-102	A	A	I've only been spending it as a college fund...Exactly twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty-eight cents.
ID-103	A	A	BILLIE That's very specific.
ID-104	A	A	CHRIS I had to go to the bank this morning.
ID-105	A	A	7.
ID-106	A	A	WALT Well, we'll certainly contribute the balance for Harvard.
ID-107	A	A	CHRIS Yeah.
ID-108	A	A	I've got to figure out what I'm going to do.
ID-109	A	A	I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.
ID-110	A	A	BILLIE I'm so glad you're getting out of that place you're living.
ID-111	A	A	It was so much nicer when you lived on campus.
ID-112	A	A	WALT You'll come to Annandale before you disappear on us, won't you?
ID-113	A	A	CHRIS (reluctantly) Sure, I will.
ID-114	A	A	Carine's not so sure.
ID-115	A	A	BILLIE You promise?

ID-121	A	A	CHRIS (CONT'D) The Datsun?
ID-122	A	A	WALT Yes.
ID-123	A	A	We want to get you a new car.
ID-124	A	A	CHRIS (appalled) A new car?
ID-125	A	A	Why the hell would I want a new car?
ID-126	A	A	The Datsun runs great.
ID-127	A	A	(MORE)  8.
ID-128	A	A	CHRIS (CONT'D) (Mocking the Cadillac) Do you think I want some fancy boat?
ID-129	A	A	Or are you worried about what the neighbors might think?
ID-130	A	A	BILLIE We weren't going to get you a Cadillac, Chris.
ID-131	A	A	Just a nice new car that's safe to drive.
ID-132	A	A	You don't know when that thing's just going to suddenly blow up.

ID-143	A	A	WALT Everything's gotta be difficult.
ID-144	A	A	CHRIS I said thank you.
ID-145	A	A	I just don't want anything.
ID-146	A	A	The group returns to some superficial calm.

ID-155	A	A	And with a parting smile to her brother, she poses with it on her own head.
ID-156	A	A	Chris smiles and waves goodbye.
ID-157	A	A	As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into something other than sadness.

ID-159	A	A	OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT                         8  In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."
ID-160	A	A	We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
ID-161	A	A	Beside them, a camper's backpack.
ID-162	D	A	Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
ID-163	D	A	The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle.
ID-164	D	A	But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope.
ID-165	D	A	He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope.
ID-166	D	A	He scribbles a note: These are all my savings.
ID-167	D	A	Feed someone with it.

ID-194	D	D	Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.
ID-195	D	D	In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.

ID-200	D	D	His head supported by his backpack.
ID-201	D	D	We begin to HEAR a rumble.
ID-202	D	D	But this rumble is not thunder.

ID-208	D	D	A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water.
ID-209	D	D	Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff.
ID-210	D	D	CRACK!
ID-211	D	D	Chris sits upright, disoriented.
ID-212	D	D	POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.
ID-213	D	D	However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield.
ID-214	D	D	The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels.
ID-215	D	D	Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff.

ID-385	D	D	Chris had instructed the post office to hold them until August 1st so that mom and dad wouldn't know that anything was up.
ID-386	D	D	Some part of me understood what he had done.
ID-387	D	D	That he had spent the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in graduating from college.
ID-388	D	D	We return to the image of Carine sitting on her bed as she plops on Chris' old graduation cap.

ID-409	D	D	Chris bows to the sign as one would to speak to a small child.
ID-410	D	D	CHRIS (singing) Sign, sign.
ID-411	D	D	Everywhere a sign.
ID-412	D	D	Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind.
ID-413	D	D	(MORE)  21.
ID-414	D	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) Do this.
ID-415	D	D	Don't do that.
ID-416	D	D	Can't you read the sign?
ID-417	D	D	And then, very impulsively, he karate kicks the sign off its post into a log collapsing into ---  CUT TO:   30   OMITTED                                                     30   31   EXT.

ID-421	D	D	He quickly grabs a knife from his backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open.
ID-422	D	D	We see his eyes peering out.
ID-423	D	D	The CRACKLING moves closer.
ID-424	D	D	His grip on the knife tightens.
ID-425	D	D	Suddenly a hot white light hits his face.
ID-426	D	D	And a VOICE comes from behind the light.
ID-427	D	D	FOREST RANGER U.S. Forestry.
ID-428	D	D	Could you step out of the tent please?
ID-429	D	D	Now we see the FOREST RANGER appear from the thicket.
ID-430	D	D	Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.
ID-431	D	D	CHRIS (as he drops the knife to the ground) Sorry.
ID-432	D	D	I thought you were a bear.
ID-433	D	D	FOREST RANGER (approaching) I don't blame you.
ID-434	D	D	You're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den.
ID-435	D	D	That's why I came over here to talk to you.
ID-436	D	D	Do you have some identification?
ID-437	D	D	22.
ID-438	D	D	CHRIS No.
ID-439	D	D	I'm sorry.
ID-440	D	D	My name's Alex.
ID-441	D	D	I've been travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken.
ID-442	D	D	FOREST RANGER You mind if I take a look in your tent?
ID-443	D	D	CHRIS Go ahead.
ID-444	D	D	The Forest Ranger bends over.
ID-445	D	D	Pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re- addressing Chris.
ID-446	D	D	FOREST RANGER You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?
ID-447	D	D	CHRIS (giggles) No.
ID-448	D	D	FOREST RANGER Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
ID-449	D	D	CHRIS Well, I don't have a permit.
ID-450	D	D	FOREST RANGER No, I'm sure you don't.
ID-451	D	D	Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight.
ID-452	D	D	But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes.
ID-453	D	D	Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit.
ID-454	D	D	CHRIS Alright.
ID-455	D	D	I appreciate it.
ID-456	D	D	I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.

ID-462	D	D	Every perilous step creates a mini landslide down the hill
ID-463	D	D	Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial airliner.
ID-464	D	D	CHRIS (mocking imaginary conversation among passengers) Is that a man mommy?
ID-465	D	D	That's no mere man, sweetheart.
ID-466	D	D	That's Alexander SuperTramp!
ID-467	D	D	King of the wild frontier!

ID-480	D	D	He turns to move north by foot and we track with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb.
ID-481	D	D	Something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road.
ID-482	D	D	24.
ID-483	D	D	REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object.
ID-484	D	D	As he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.
ID-485	D	D	He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.
ID-486	D	D	With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard the police car.
ID-487	D	D	The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and moves to Chris.
ID-488	D	D	POLICEMAN How're you doin' this evening?
ID-489	D	D	CHRIS (reluctantly) I'm alright.
ID-490	D	D	What's the matter?
ID-491	D	D	POLICEMAN You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car.
ID-492	D	D	Chris does not oblige.
ID-493	D	D	CHRIS Why?
ID-494	D	D	POLICEMAN Because I asked you to, sir.
ID-495	D	D	CHRIS But I haven't done anything wrong.
ID-496	D	D	These are my personal items.
ID-497	D	D	POLICEMAN Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
ID-498	D	D	CHRIS You're kidding.
ID-499	D	D	POLICEMAN Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop?
ID-500	D	D	We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here.
ID-501	D	D	And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.
ID-502	D	D	CHRIS Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car.
ID-503	D	D	You're in the traffic lane.
ID-504	D	D	And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here.
ID-505	D	D	Plus, it's a straight road
ID-506	D	D	(MORE)  25.
ID-507	D	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) (in disbelief) There's really been accidents along here?
ID-508	D	D	POLICEMAN May I see some identification?
ID-509	D	D	Now Chris is worried.
ID-510	D	D	CHRIS I don't have any.
ID-511	D	D	POLICEMAN You don't have any identification?
ID-512	D	D	Chris shakes his head "No."
ID-513	D	D	POLICEMAN (CONT'D) (pulling out a ticket) Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful hitchhiking.
ID-514	D	D	You don't have to appear.
ID-515	D	D	You can send a check directly to the Humboldt County Clerks Office for restitution.
ID-516	D	D	If you don't pay it within 30 days, you're subject to fine and warrant.
ID-517	D	D	I'm gonna trust that you're gonna give me accurate information.

ID-239	F	D	QUICK PAN back to Chris.
ID-240	F	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) (in mock fright) We've got to get out of here quick and re- secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast.
ID-241	F	D	CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the hatchway into the University dorm corridor.
ID-242	F	D	CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in the hatchway from below.
ID-243	F	D	He climbs down the steps where he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off- camera source.
ID-244	F	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) Well, it looks like we've succeeded -  We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.
ID-245	F	D	13.
ID-246	F	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) - at least for the moment, in sealing the beast back into the vault.
ID-247	F	D	Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?
ID-248	F	D	He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do?
ID-249	F	D	CONTINUE VIDEO:  We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of Ted Turner.
ID-250	F	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) Once again, your humble reporter Chris McCandless.
ID-251	F	D	We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video crew:  OS STUDENT What is this?
ID-252	F	D	Filmmaking 101?
ID-253	F	D	OS STUDENT #2 Point the camera at me.
ID-254	F	D	I'm a star.

ID-257	F	D	WOULD-BE TED TURNER OFFICE                             15  A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.
ID-258	F	D	CHRIS Ted!
ID-259	F	D	We've got a monster in the vault.
ID-260	F	D	It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all.
ID-261	F	D	I must slay it.
ID-262	F	D	14.
ID-263	F	D	TED TURNER/STUDENT (worst acting we've ever seen) McCandless, how many times have I had to tell you?
ID-264	F	D	I've had to tell you that you are a journalist and you can't get personally involved in your cases...or your stories.
ID-265	F	D	CHRIS Ted!
ID-266	F	D	I know how to kill it.
ID-267	F	D	And I'm the only one who knows.
ID-268	F	D	You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing!
ID-269	F	D	I look like some kind of an idiot.
ID-270	F	D	TED TURNER/STUDENT Do you know who you're talking to?
ID-271	F	D	I'm Ted Turner.
ID-272	F	D	Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.
ID-273	F	D	PANICKED STUDENT McCandless!
ID-274	F	D	You've got to hurry!
ID-275	F	D	The monster is scratching at the hatchway.
ID-276	F	D	He'll be out in no time.
ID-277	F	D	TED TURNER/STUDENT (threatening) It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.
ID-278	F	D	CHRIS (to Ted) That's it, Ted.
ID-279	F	D	Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed.
ID-280	F	D	Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste.
ID-281	F	D	The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway.
ID-282	F	D	As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed.
ID-283	F	D	CHRIS (CONT'D) (into camera) This is the only thing that can kill the monster.
ID-284	F	D	It's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom.
ID-285	F	D	So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris McCandless.
ID-286	F	D	15.
ID-287	F	D	A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris.
ID-288	F	D	A YOUNG BLACK STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play.
ID-289	F	D	Chris begins to serenade the monster, intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well.
ID-290	F	D	He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is The Night.
ID-291	F	D	CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung.
ID-292	F	D	As the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO TO SLO MO.
ID-293	F	D	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-294	F	D	When we were little, Chris was very to himself.
ID-295	F	D	He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends.
ID-296	F	D	He could be alone without being lonely.
ID-297	F	D	The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young.
ID-298	F	D	It seemed like they never fought without us.
ID-299	F	D	I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce.
ID-300	F	D	They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with.
ID-301	F	D	I cried my eyes out.
ID-302	F	D	But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped.
ID-303	F	D	It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
ID-304	F	D	Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money.
ID-305	F	D	Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik.
ID-306	F	D	And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge.
ID-307	F	D	By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us.
ID-308	F	D	(MORE)  16.
ID-309	F	D	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-310	F	D	(CONT'D) I think this is when Chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives.
ID-311	F	D	He'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

ID-342	F	D	Spits it out.
ID-343	F	D	Then checks his bearded face in the mirror.
ID-344	F	D	He likes what he sees.
ID-345	F	D	As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a discarded tube of lipstick.

ID-656	A	F	RAINEY (CONT'D) You're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times.
ID-657	A	F	I've loved that woman for a lot of years.
ID-658	A	F	But you know, she's got a...story.
ID-659	A	F	We've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well...So, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about.
ID-660	A	F	You know what I mean?
ID-661	A	F	CHRIS I think so.
ID-662	A	F	RAINEY You think what?
ID-663	A	F	Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.
ID-664	A	F	CHRIS I think she's probably quietly disconnecting.
ID-665	A	F	It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.
ID-666	A	F	RAINEY That's a helluva insight.
ID-667	A	F	Jesus!...
ID-668	A	F	You're not Jesus, are you?
ID-669	A	F	You gonna walk on that water and get her back for me?
ID-670	A	F	CHRIS Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.
ID-671	A	F	Rainey gives him a sideways glance.
ID-672	A	F	CHRIS (CONT'D) It's true.

ID-680	A	F	ANGLE: Rainey.
ID-681	A	F	A warmth comes over him, watching his old lady having some fun.

ID-684	A	F	Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with Chris.
ID-685	A	F	And Chris allows it.

ID-690	A	F	Rainey sits beside the campfire.
ID-691	A	F	RAINEY I thought you guys might need a little heat.
ID-692	A	F	Jan smiles appreciatively.
ID-693	A	F	JAN (moving to Rainey) That's not hot enough.
ID-694	A	F	Put your arms around me.
ID-695	A	F	As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent, puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book.
ID-696	A	F	Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit beside the fire.
ID-697	A	F	33.
ID-698	A	F	CHRIS I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit.
ID-699	A	F	I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall.
ID-700	A	F	RAINEY Alright.
ID-701	A	F	We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight.

ID-725	A	F	JAN You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey?
ID-726	A	F	He ought to come out to the Slabs this winter.
ID-727	A	F	34.
ID-728	A	F	RAINEY Oh yeah.
ID-729	A	F	Rainey takes a toke on the joint.
ID-730	A	F	RAINEY (CONT'D) You'd like that if you're still on the road.
ID-731	A	F	Lot of fellow travelers.
ID-732	A	F	Rainey offers the joint to Chris.

ID-526	D	F	Walt's on the phone.
ID-527	D	F	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-528	D	F	If Chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence.
ID-529	D	F	Though my parents had already contacted the Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from California made them frantic.
ID-530	D	F	(MORE)  26.
ID-531	D	F	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-532	D	F	(CONT'D) My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.
ID-533	F	F	Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads.
ID-534	F	F	Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa.
ID-535	F	F	Ultimately turning up nothing.
ID-536	F	F	What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car.
ID-537	F	F	He seemed to love that Datsun so much.
ID-538	F	F	It sounded just like Chris to me, though.
ID-539	F	F	He was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run.

ID-542	F	F	(Director's note: Don't leave this image too soon.)
ID-543	F	F	An old van idles waiting for him.
ID-544	F	F	As he gets to the passenger side, the woman passenger gets out.
ID-545	F	F	This is JAN BURRES, early 40's, looks to be still on the long road home from Woodstock.
ID-546	F	F	A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot of premature grey in it.
ID-547	F	F	Jan moving to the side door.
ID-548	F	F	JAN Hi.
ID-549	F	F	We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours.
ID-550	F	F	We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken.
ID-551	F	F	CHRIS (as Jan fiddles with side door handle) Oh.
ID-552	F	F	That's okay.
ID-553	F	F	Thanks for stopping.
ID-554	F	F	JAN This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.
ID-555	F	F	And with a little pulling, it opens.
ID-556	F	F	Indicating the pony- tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's, definitely Woodstock...  JAN (CONT'D) Hop in, that's Rainey.
ID-557	F	F	27.
ID-558	F	F	RAINEY Hey, I'm Rainey.
ID-559	F	F	JAN And I'm Jan.  CHRIS Hey, Rainey.
ID-561	F	F	I'm Alex.
ID-562	F	F	RAINEY Alex of the hat.
ID-563	F	F	CHRIS (closing the side door) Yeah.

ID-567	F	F	RAINEY Were you out there a long time hitching?
ID-568	F	F	CHRIS Couple of days.
ID-569	F	F	But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out.
ID-570	F	F	JAN Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares `em away.
ID-571	F	F	Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.)
ID-572	F	F	Jan is looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with mild concern.
ID-573	F	F	JAN (CONT'D) When's the last time you ate something?
ID-574	F	F	Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's collected.
ID-575	F	F	CHRIS (excited) See that?
ID-576	F	F	I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible.
ID-577	F	F	You can find things wherever you go.
ID-578	F	F	Jan steals a glance to Rainey.
ID-579	F	F	He's hip.
ID-580	F	F	28.
ID-581	F	F	RAINEY We were just in town getting some beads and stuff.
ID-582	F	F	Jan does handicrafts, so we're usually going from one swap meet to another.
ID-583	F	F	She's so good at what she does, we sold everything.
ID-584	F	F	So, we set up camp at Orick Beach.
ID-585	F	F	You're welcome to camp there with us.
ID-586	F	F	JAN And eat there with us.
ID-587	F	F	Chris is beaming at the thought of real food.

ID-589	F	F	CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - NIGHT                         40  Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on blankets.
ID-590	F	F	Their tents loom behind them.
ID-591	F	F	Jan is weaving some sort of craft art.
ID-592	F	F	Chris is chomping on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.
ID-593	F	F	CHRIS (between large swallows) So, I just left the car.
ID-594	F	F	It was a great car too.
ID-595	F	F	I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school.
ID-596	F	F	I had some really great adventures with it.
ID-597	F	F	That thing would just go and go.
ID-598	F	F	I mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever.
ID-599	F	F	RAINEY So, you're a leather now.
ID-600	F	F	CHRIS I'm a leather?
ID-601	F	F	Rainey nods, smiling.
ID-602	F	F	CHRIS (CONT'D) (looking to Jan) What's a leather?
ID-603	F	F	JAN You're a leather tramp.
ID-604	F	F	That's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot.
ID-605	F	F	So, we're technically rubber tramps.
ID-606	F	F	29.
ID-607	F	F	RAINEY (interjecting) As we have a vee-hi-cle.
ID-608	F	F	Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes a little stiff and fends it off.
ID-609	F	F	Chris notices.
ID-610	F	F	JAN Alex could have a vehicle.
ID-611	F	F	If he didn't burn his money.
ID-612	F	F	Why would you want to do that?
ID-613	F	F	CHRIS I don't need money.
ID-614	F	F	It makes people cautious.
ID-615	F	F	JAN (a little irritated) Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex.
ID-616	F	F	That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.
ID-617	F	F	CHRIS I don't know if you'd want to depend on much more than that.
ID-618	F	F	JAN Where's your mom and dad?
ID-619	F	F	CHRIS Makin' their money somewhere.
ID-620	F	F	JAN Come on Chris.
ID-621	F	F	You look like a loved             * kid.
ID-622	F	F	Be fair.
ID-623	F	F	* CHRIS Fair?
ID-624	F	F	JAN You know what I mean.
ID-625	F	F	CHRIS I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- "Rather than          * love, than money, than fairness, give me         * truth."
ID-626	F	F	*  RAINEY                              * You look like shit.
ID-627	F	F	There's the truth.

ID-631	F	F	CHRIS' TENT, ORICK BEACH - LATER                       41  Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let the small candle lantern ventilate.
ID-632	F	F	OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND.
ID-633	F	F	It's Rainey.
ID-634	F	F	We see him from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.
ID-635	F	F	As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire.
ID-636	F	F	The tapping is slow and thoughtful.
ID-637	F	F	Micro-embers float upward into the night.
ID-638	F	F	Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand.
ID-639	F	F	ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.

ID-641	F	F	ORICK BEACH - DAY                                      42  We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above the beach.
ID-642	F	F	He's got it tied to his back and his front.
ID-643	F	F	If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging himself.
ID-644	F	F	Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge.
ID-645	F	F	We see Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea.
ID-646	F	F	We follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction of Rainey.
ID-647	F	F	ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.
ID-648	F	F	Chris appears beside him.
ID-649	F	F	RAINEY (regarding Chris wrapped up in wood) Geez.
ID-650	F	F	If I struck a match to you, I'd have warmth and dinner at the same time.
ID-651	F	F	31.
ID-652	F	F	But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.
ID-653	F	F	CHRIS Where's Jan going?
ID-654	F	F	RAINEY Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
ID-735	F	F	The Slabs?
ID-736	F	F	RAINEY It's down in Niland, California.
ID-737	F	F	You know where the Salton Sea is?
ID-738	F	F	CHRIS Near San Diego, yeah?
ID-739	F	F	RAINEY Well about 200 miles Northeast of there, but yeah.
ID-740	F	F	Niland's off the east shore of Salton.
ID-741	F	F	Wild place.
ID-742	F	F	The navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there.
ID-743	F	F	All that's left is a grid of concrete foundations.
ID-744	F	F	They're scattered over about a square mile or so.
ID-745	J	F	JAN When the weather turns cold across the rest of the country, people show up there by the thousands: snow birds... RAINEY Drifters...  JAN Sundry vagabonds...  RAINEY / JAN Like ourselves.
ID-746	J	F	JAN Livin' on the cheap under the sun.
ID-747	J	F	CHRIS You sell your handcrafts there?
ID-748	J	F	35.
ID-749	J	F	JAN Oh yeah.
ID-750	J	F	And a lot of second-hand goods.
ID-751	J	F	There's a swap meet.
ID-752	J	F	The people are cool.
ID-753	J	F	There's even some kids running around sometimes.
ID-754	J	F	Most everyone there, if they're not avoiding the cold, are at least dodging the IRS.
ID-755	J	F	RAINEY Or the FBI.
ID-756	J	F	CIA!
ID-757	J	F	DDT!!!
ID-758	J	F	The three of them laugh.
ID-759	J	F	JAN It's good.
ID-760	J	F	You should check it out.
ID-761	J	F	If you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.
ID-762	J	F	(standing, shaking out her blanket) Well, Alex.
ID-763	J	F	I'm gonna clean up and the old man and I are gonna get some rest.
ID-764	J	F	(indicating the sleeping bag) Looks like you got yourself a good bag there.
ID-560	F	F	Hi Jan.
ID-868	D	J	If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.
ID-869	D	J	And he made me promise to do the same.
ID-870	D	J	(MORE)  40.
ID-871	D	J	CARINE (CONT'D) He never did tell mom and dad that he knew.
ID-872	D	J	But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code.
ID-873	D	J	He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance.
ID-874	D	J	Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time.
ID-875	D	J	It was inevitable that Chris would rebel.
ID-876	D	J	And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.
ID-877	D	J	Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk.
ID-878	D	J	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-879	D	J	(CONT'D) My father is a brilliant man.
ID-880	D	J	But he had made some terrible mistakes.
ID-881	D	J	And to some extent, it seemed Chris was making him pay an awful price.

ID-884	D	J	As Chris jumps in, we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE WESTERBERG boldly painted across it.
ID-885	D	J	Chris hops in beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a black goatee.
ID-886	D	J	WAYNE (rolling a cigarette without moving forward with the truck, his knees rattling up and down) How're you doing?
ID-887	D	J	Wayne Westerberg.
ID-888	D	J	CHRIS (shaking hands) Hi Wayne.
ID-889	D	J	Alex McCandless.
ID-890	D	J	WAYNE Seems like every time I come on this road, there's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you.
ID-891	D	J	Chris nods with a laugh.
ID-892	D	J	Wayne continuing...  41.
ID-893	D	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop something off (know what I mean?)
ID-894	D	J	Chris is not sure about the "drop something off" part.
ID-895	D	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) How `bout you and I grab something to eat down there?
ID-896	D	J	CHRIS Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.
ID-897	D	J	WAYNE How long has it been since you've had anything to eat?
ID-898	D	J	CHRIS Couple of days.
ID-899	D	J	I kinda ran out of money.
ID-900	D	J	WAYNE Well, there's no choice about it.
ID-901	D	J	I'm gonna get you some dinner.
ID-902	D	J	Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and they head down the road.

ID-906	D	J	Beside them, a Wyeth-esque farmhouse.
ID-907	D	J	He eases the engine and comes to a stop in front of the double-wide.
ID-908	D	J	As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a hushing finger across the lips.
ID-909	D	J	They tip-toe up to the door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys.
ID-765	J	J	CHRIS Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.
ID-766	J	J	Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris, but he pushes it away quickly.
ID-767	J	J	CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm gonna sleep out here by the fire.
ID-768	J	J	I want to read a little bit.
ID-769	J	J	Jan moves to Chris, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek.

ID-774	J	J	Chris reads from Thoreau's WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's tent.
ID-775	J	J	A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its irony, he looks to the page before him.

ID-781	J	J	There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night.

ID-783	J	J	Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes.
ID-784	J	J	She wears a sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices that Chris has left.
ID-785	J	J	But where his tent had been, the words:  THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY  are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood.

ID-808	J	J	In early September, mom and dad got a call from the Annandale police notifying them that Chris' abandoned car had been identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol after a group of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert.
ID-809	J	J	There were no signs that Chris had intended to return to it.
ID-810	J	J	But there wasn't any evidence of struggle.
ID-811	J	J	The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him.
ID-812	J	J	Nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that Chris was actually trying not to be found.

ID-820	J	J	He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit our old neighborhood in California.
ID-821	J	J	The day before he left was my dad's birthday.
ID-822	J	J	Chris made a speech...  38.
ID-823	J	J	51   INT.
ID-824	J	J	MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)                      51  Chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party of his parent's friends, Walt and Billie among them.
ID-825	J	J	Beside him, a large gift-wrapped present.
ID-826	J	J	Carine sits at the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching her brother with a hint of concern.
ID-827	J	J	CHRIS (a little drunk, a little emotional) Dad, you and I have had our differences over the years...but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for all the things you've given me.
ID-828	J	J	And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids.
ID-829	J	J	So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit...at Domino's Pizza -  Chris moves to the gift.
ID-830	J	J	CHRIS (CONT'D) and I've gotten you this token, this damned expensive token, as a token of that appreciation.
ID-831	J	J	Chris holds the large gift toward Walt.
ID-832	J	J	Walt moves through his friends to Chris and strips the paper, exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.
ID-833	J	J	WALT (patting his son the back) Would you look at that.
ID-834	J	J	Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.
ID-835	J	J	And the party responds with applause.
ID-836	J	J	Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.
ID-837	J	J	CARINE Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.
ID-838	J	J	CHRIS Too much and not enough.
ID-839	J	J	I used to believe all that stuff.
ID-840	J	J	That whole story.
ID-841	J	J	I thought maybe if I said it again, I'd believe it.
ID-842	J	J	But I don't.
ID-843	J	J	39.
ID-844	J	J	Tears have come to Chris' eyes.
ID-845	J	J	He puts his head in his hands.
ID-846	J	J	Carine puts an arm around him.
ID-847	J	J	BACK TO:   52   EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               52  PRESENT:   Walt expressionless, walking into camera.
ID-848	J	J	CARINE (V.O.)
ID-849	J	J	The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer.
ID-850	J	J	It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale.
ID-851	J	J	He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin.
ID-852	J	J	As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
ID-853	J	J	In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there.
ID-854	J	J	He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.
ID-855	J	J	53   EXT CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET                            53  BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.
ID-856	J	J	CARINE And that one lie had led to another.
ID-857	J	J	That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia.
ID-858	J	J	Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time.
ID-859	J	J	And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children.
ID-860	J	J	BACK TO:   54   EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               54  Walt.
ID-861	J	J	CARINE Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused.
ID-862	J	J	And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice.
ID-863	J	J	(MORE)  39aA.
ID-864	J	J	CARINE (CONT'D) She and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasn't the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real.
ID-865	J	J	(MORE)  39A.
ID-866	J	J	CARINE (CONT'D) Chris was quiet when he told me this.
ID-867	J	J	He said it made his "entire childhood seem like a fiction"
ID-910	J	J	A little thunder kicking in the distant sky.
ID-911	J	J	41A.
ID-912	J	J	56A   INT.
ID-913	J	J	DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT                                  56A  As Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze bottles and passed out work crew
ID-914	J	J	They make their way to a small table in the kitchenette.
ID-915	J	J	Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove.
ID-916	J	J	Wayne turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.
ID-917	J	J	WAYNE So where is it you're headed?
ID-918	J	J	CHRIS I was thinking about doubling back through the Canadian side of Glacier Park.
ID-919	J	J	WAYNE Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the Black Feet Res.
ID-920	J	J	She was into all that American Indian stuff.
ID-921	J	J	(MORE)  42.
ID-922	J	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) I can bring you to the border at Sweet Grass once you've had some food.
ID-923	J	J	CHRIS Well, that'd be great.
ID-924	J	J	What do you do out here?
ID-925	J	J	WAYNE Well, I do a lot of things.
ID-926	J	J	Computer programming.
ID-927	J	J	Video game repair.
ID-928	J	J	I'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town.
ID-929	J	J	But in the summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian border.
ID-930	J	J	We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch.
ID-931	J	J	But then I got this little black box deal on the side (You know what I mean?)
ID-932	J	J	CHRIS You mean those free satellite TV deals?
ID-933	J	J	WAYNE (as though he hadn't brought it up) You said it, not me.
ID-934	J	J	Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.
ID-935	J	J	Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food.
ID-936	J	J	As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind rocks the trailer.
ID-937	J	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) (smiling, responding to wind) OOOOOOH.
ID-938	J	J	Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food.
ID-939	J	J	Points to the unconscious tribe splayed out.
ID-940	J	J	SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.
ID-941	J	J	CHRIS Who are these guys?
ID-942	J	J	Wayne gets a little giggle.
ID-943	J	J	WAYNE Those are my Hudderites.
ID-944	J	J	Agriculture's a pretty transient business.
ID-945	J	J	These guys come off the Hudderite colony looking for work.
ID-946	J	J	I always got work for people.
ID-947	J	J	Then that guy - (MORE)  42A.
ID-948	J	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) (pointing at guy making most of his snore) That's Kevin.
ID-949	J	J	He's with me most of the time.
ID-950	J	J	He's not a Hudderite.
ID-951	J	J	He's from Madison.
ID-952	J	J	CHRIS Madison.
ID-953	J	J	Okay.
ID-954	J	J	Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell.
ID-955	J	J	A couple hits of lightning follow.
ID-956	J	J	WAYNE Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight.
ID-957	J	J	Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning.
ID-958	J	J	Chris looks about.
ID-959	J	J	There's not much room but it beats the pelting outside.
ID-960	J	J	CHRIS Thanks Wayne.
ID-961	J	J	I will.
ID-962	J	J	TIME CUT:  Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN.
ID-963	J	J	Wayne comes from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping bodies to hand Chris a pillow.
ID-964	J	J	WAYNE Get a good sleep.
ID-965	J	J	See you in the morning.
ID-966	J	J	Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head and closes his eyes.

ID-969	J	J	43.
ID-970	J	J	WAYNE (O.S) Okay.
ID-971	J	J	Now take hold of the joystick, get the feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch...  As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.
ID-972	J	J	WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine.
ID-973	J	J	In the background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain.
ID-974	J	J	Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.
ID-975	J	J	This time the thing starts to move.
ID-976	J	J	WAYNE (CONT'D) That's it.
ID-977	J	J	That's it.
ID-978	J	J	Now take it on out and make yourself some money.
ID-979	J	J	Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.
ID-980	J	J	Wayne laughs his ass off.

ID-985	J	J	WAYNE I'm gonna break out some whiskey.
ID-986	J	J	Alex, you want anything other than that beer?
ID-987	J	J	CHRIS I'd take a White Russian if you've got it.
ID-988	J	J	The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a fancy drink.
ID-989	J	J	44.
ID-990	J	J	MAN #1 What are you Alex, a Commie?
ID-991	J	J	CHRIS No, I just like White Russians.
ID-992	J	J	WAYNE I haven't got anything like that here.
ID-993	J	J	But I tell ya what.
ID-994	J	J	And I know I speak for everybody.
