ID-661 	anger	noEmo	CHRIS I think so.
ID-662 	anger	noEmo	RAINEY You think what?
ID-663 	anger	noEmo	Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.
ID-664 	anger	noEmo	CHRIS I think she's probably quietly disconnecting.
ID-665 	anger	mixedEmo	It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.
ID-666 	anger	noEmo	RAINEY That's a helluva insight.
ID-667 	anger	noEmo	Jesus!...
