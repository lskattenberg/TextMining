ID-4 ;negative;A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop.
ID-5 ;negative;A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck.
ID-6 ;negative;We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack.

ID-9 ;negative;The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.
ID-10 ;negative;DRIVER (CONT'D) Come here.
ID-11 ;negative;BACKPACK walks back to the truck.
ID-12 ;negative;As he approaches the driver's door, we  CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER.
ID-13 ;negative;DRIVER (CONT'D) (referring to items we see sitting on dashboard) You left your watch, your comb, your change...  We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:  BACKPACK Keep it.

ID-20 ;negative;None of that matters.
ID-21 ;negative;The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots.
ID-22 ;negative;DRIVER (handing him the boots) Take em.
ID-23 ;negative;There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.
ID-24 ;negative;DRIVER (CONT'D) If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
ID-25 ;negative;We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
ID-26 ;negative;BACKPACK Hey, do me a favor, will ya?
ID-27 ;negative;Take a picture of me.
ID-28 ;negative;Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards.

ID-55 ;negative;INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.
ID-56 ;negative;From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.

ID-66 ;negative;I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die.

ID-443;neutral;CHRIS Go ahead.
ID-444;neutral;The Forest Ranger bends over.
ID-445;neutral;Pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re- addressing Chris.
ID-446;neutral;FOREST RANGER You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?
ID-447;neutral;CHRIS (giggles) No.
ID-448;neutral;FOREST RANGER Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
ID-449;neutral;CHRIS Well, I don't have a permit.
ID-450;neutral;FOREST RANGER No, I'm sure you don't.
ID-451;neutral;Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight.
ID-452;neutral;But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes.
ID-453;neutral;Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit.
ID-454;neutral;CHRIS Alright.
ID-455;neutral;I appreciate it.
ID-456;neutral;I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.

ID-267 ;positive;And I'm the only one who knows.

ID-294 ;positive;When we were little, Chris was very to himself.
ID-295 ;positive;He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends.
ID-296 ;positive;He could be alone without being lonely.
ID-297 ;positive;The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young.
ID-298 ;positive;It seemed like they never fought without us.
ID-299 ;positive;I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce.
ID-300 ;positive;They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with.
ID-301 ;positive;I cried my eyes out.
ID-302 ;positive;But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped.
ID-303 ;positive;It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
ID-304 ;positive;Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money.
ID-305 ;positive;Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik.
ID-306 ;positive;And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge.
ID-307 ;positive;By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us.

ID-552 ;positive;That's okay.
ID-553 ;positive;Thanks for stopping.

ID-568 ;positive;CHRIS Couple of days.
ID-569 ;positive;But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out.
ID-570 ;positive;JAN Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares `em away.
ID-571 ;positive;Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.)
ID-572 ;positive;Jan is looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with mild concern.
ID-573 ;positive;JAN (CONT'D) When's the last time you ate something?
ID-574 ;positive;Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's collected.
ID-575 ;positive;CHRIS (excited) See that?
ID-576 ;positive;I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible.
ID-577 ;positive;You can find things wherever you go.

ID-592 ;positive;Chris is chomping on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.
ID-593 ;positive;CHRIS (between large swallows) So, I just left the car.
ID-594 ;positive;It was a great car too.
ID-595 ;positive;I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school.
ID-596 ;positive;I had some really great adventures with it.
ID-597 ;positive;That thing would just go and go.
ID-598 ;positive;I mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever.
ID-599 ;positive;RAINEY So, you're a leather now.
ID-600 ;positive;CHRIS I'm a leather?
ID-601 ;positive;Rainey nods, smiling.
ID-602 ;positive;CHRIS (CONT'D) (looking to Jan) What's a leather?
ID-603 ;positive;JAN You're a leather tramp.

ID-607 ;positive;RAINEY (interjecting) As we have a vee-hi-cle.
ID-608 ;positive;Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes a little stiff and fends it off.
ID-609 ;positive;Chris notices.
ID-610 ;positive;JAN Alex could have a vehicle.
ID-611 ;positive;If he didn't burn his money.
ID-612 ;positive;Why would you want to do that?
ID-613 ;positive;CHRIS I don't need money.
ID-614 ;positive;It makes people cautious.
ID-615 ;positive;JAN (a little irritated) Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex.
ID-616 ;positive;That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.

ID-633 ;positive;It's Rainey.
ID-634 ;positive;We see him from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.
ID-635 ;positive;As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire.
